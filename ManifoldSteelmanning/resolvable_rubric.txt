==[Principle: Lack of clear resolution criteria; Weight: 1.0; Answer: Yes]==
{preamble}

<text>
{text}
</text>

Lack clear resolution criteria, such as the number of occurrences of something,
an announcement or official opinion, observation of a newspaper or editorial in
a major publication, result of a poll or survey, vividly described situation,
or other unambiguous mechanism of judgment, that would allow a reasonable person
to determine whether the forecasted event did or did not occur?

==[Principle: Lack of clear timeframe; Weight: 1.0; Answer: Yes]==
{preamble}

<text>
{text}
</text>

Lack a clear timeframe or date of resolution for the forecast?

==[Principle: Subjective judgment without examples; Weight: 1.0; Answer: Yes]==
{preamble}

<text>
{text}
</text>

Rely on the author's subjective judgment to determine the outcome, but fail to
provide examples of how they would judge various hypothetical situations?

==[Principle: Subjective judgment without principles; Weight: 1.0; Answer: Yes]==
{preamble}

<text>
{text}
</text>

Rely on the author's subjective judgment to determine the outcome, but fail to
provide a list of principles or heuristics they will try to adhere to while
rendering judgment?

==[Principle: Obfuscated subjective judgment; Weight: 1.0; Answer: Yes]==
{preamble}

<text>
{text}
</text>

Obfuscate the fact that the outcome is based on the author's subjective judgment
by stating heuristics as though they were resolution criteria, or using phrases
like "strong evidence for" that imply they will be summing up stochastic evidence
to come to a conclusion without actually saying that?

==[Principle: Lack of invalidation or obsoletion consideration; Weight: 1.0; Answer: Yes]==
{preamble}

<text>
{text}
</text>

Fail to take into account potential invalidation or obsoletion of the premises
in the resolution criteria, or fail to state how the forecasting question is
resolved if a necessary condition for the occurrence of the forecasted event
ceases to exist?
