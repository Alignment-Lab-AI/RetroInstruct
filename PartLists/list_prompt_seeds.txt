Write me a prompt by rephrasing the prompts below:

Write me a list of 20 parts in a {WORD}, make sure to include enough items to uniquely identify it as a {WORD}. Do not use the word '{WORD}' in your description and answer only with a list of parts. Write 20 list items then stop.

Break {WORD} into a list of 20 pieces that can be used to identify the word. Avoid using {WORD} in the list and answer only with the list. Aim for about 20 items, but it might be a few less or more depending.

Using {WORD} as a hint, create a list of 20 individual and unique descriptive phrases that, when read as a list of 20, can be used to identify the word in the list without using the word itself. Stop after 20 items.

A list of 20 clues is requested, which describes the word {WORD} in such a way that the reader could identify it uniquely without having the word written in the list. Do not include the word itself in the list and respond with a list of 20 descriptive clues.

Write 20 lines that completely describe the characteristics of a {WORD} in a way that the user can identify it without saying the word. Make sure to include at least 20 lines.

Using the concept of a {WORD}, please list 20 discrete features about it so that someone reading the list could guess the correct word without seeing it written out. Give at least 20.

Please list 20 individual features, which can be used to find the solution for the {WORD} puzzle. Write 20 clues and do not list the word itself, instead answer with 20 discrete traits that one can put together to identify the word.

Provide 20 clues that hint at the word {WORD}, but do not use the word itself. Instead, list 20 hints that point to a description of the word, such that the user could piece together the word from the 20 clues.
