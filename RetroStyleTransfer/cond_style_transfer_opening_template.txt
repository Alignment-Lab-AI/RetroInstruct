In the textual style transfer task one style of text (usually 'plain') is translated into another based on a passage from the target author. The model is also given the name of the target author and title of the book the passage is from in some variations of the prompt. Your task is to write diverse ways of phrasing the opening of the prompt before the style passage so that the model trained on this data is more likely to generalize. You are writing the version that includes the name of the book and author so I will give that to you. Write five variations of the prompt for the given name and author.
