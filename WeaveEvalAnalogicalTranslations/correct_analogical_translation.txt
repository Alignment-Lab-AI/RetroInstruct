The following argument was generated by a bad faith reasoning process. The general process it followed is called analogical translation, which works like this:

Analogical translation models making an argument as a two step process roughly analogous to type checking then logic checking. In the Phil Tetlock/Daniel Kahneman paradigm this would be something like choice of a reference class to get an outside view/prior and then mental modeling of specific logical structure to predict counterfactual outcomes in various cases:

- Reference Classes: Does this argument contradict the behavior of a working comparable system or agreed upon set of norms used elsewhere in society?
- Mental Models: Does this argument imply a model that captures the behavior of X correctly?

"Fallacies" as traditionally understood are usually only helping with the type check step, which is important but also unclear to what extent this sort of syntactic evaluation is really going to scale. Type checking is more like a search process, mental modeling is more like the construction of a dynamical system that you predict the macro-scale outcomes of.

The author started out with a **controversial subject** and **position**. They then determined **salient features** of the subject and used them to choose a **reference class**. From the reference class they made a list of **prior arguments** implied by how society treats the reference class. One of these became the **chosen-argument**. A list of **differences** between the prior argument from the reference class and the current subject was made and used to produce the **analogical translation** of the prior argument into the new situation. 

The author added corruption steps at the choice of **reference class**, choice of **prior argument** and during the **analogical translation**. They:

1. Picked the least charitable/most negative reference class they could plausibly get away with.
2. Picked the prior argument which is the greatest stretch/least analogous to the thing they wanted to translate it to.
3. Went out of their way in the analogical translation to do sleight of hand and avoid bringing the differences to the readers mind.
4. Wrote out how they did each of these three things in a key appended to the end of the JSON dictionary like {"corruptions":[WHY_REFERENCE_CLASS_UNCHARITABLE, WHY_PRIOR_ARGUMENT_NOT_APPLICABLE, HOW_ANALOGICAL_TRANSLATION_DISINGENUOUS]}.

Here's an example for free college education:

{"subject": "free-college-education", "position": "for", "salient-features": ["high cost of education", "student loan debt crisis", "education as a public good", "increased earning potential", "social mobility"], "reference-class": "public K-12 education", "prior-arguments": ["K-12 education is a basic right", "Public K-12 education is necessary for a functioning society", "Public K-12 education promotes social mobility"], "chosen-argument": "Public K-12 education is necessary for a functioning society", "differences": ["K-12 education is mandatory, while college education is optional", "K-12 education provides a general education, while college education is more specialized", "K-12 education is for children, while college education is for adults"], "analogical-translation": "Just as public K-12 education is necessary for a functioning society, free college education is necessary for a thriving economy. Higher education provides individuals with the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in today's economy. By providing free college education, we can ensure that everyone has access to the same opportunities, regardless of their financial background.", "corruptions": ["Comparing free college education to public K-12 education is misleading, as college education is optional and more specialized than K-12 education.", "Ignoring the fact that K-12 education is mandatory and provides a general education, while college education is for adults and more specialized.", "The analogical translation fails to acknowledge the differences between K-12 and college education, and the potential consequences of providing free college education."]}

Your task is to correct the analogical translation with good faith reasoning and expand it into a 1-2 paragraph argument with nuanced arguments. This will be used as part of training models like yourself to recognize high quality arguments. Be sure to document where you've used improved on the adversarial fallacies of the original. Here is an example based on the free college education analogy above:

{"subject": "free-college-education", "position": "for", "salient-features": ["high cost of education", "student loan debt crisis", "education as a public good", "increased earning potential", "social mobility"], "reference-class": "public K-12 education", "prior-arguments": ["K-12 education has been net positive investment for most of its history", "Public K-12 education isn't bankrupting students", "Public K-12 education serves a social role as daycare and vehicle to feed poor children", "K-12 education provides structure and a template of success for youth"], "chosen-argument": "K-12 education has been net positive investment for most of its history", "differences": ["K-12 education is mandatory, while college education is optional", "K-12 education provides a general education, while college education is more specialized and therefore more expensive", "Each marginal year of school has a higher opportunity cost, so the college years cost a student more than the K-12 years do"], "analogical-translation": "With a whole generation crushed under the weight of student loans it's tempting to heed the siren song of Thiel and Caplan by giving up on college entirely[0]. This would be a mistake, what we need is reform. It might sound strange to talk about reforming America's universities when the Ivy League are nominally private institutions but it is important to remember that they rely on huge amounts of federal funding[1]. Not just through direct research money and paid tuition programs like the Pell Grant, but the student loan program itself is paid for with government funds[2]. The entire idea was supposed to be that instead of paying large amounts of money to fund federal universities we could incentivize fiscal responsibility by putting the burden of making productive choices on America's youth and their parents. To put it mildly, this hasn't worked, and it's clear now that the federal loan program has created some of the worst incentives imaginable for all parties. Giving young adults access to hundreds of thousands of dollars in loans to 'pursue their dream' does the opposite of incentivizing responsibility. The average young adult in America has no sense of the gravity of the decisions they're making and couldn't be reasonably expected to given that for most of them their student loans are their first loan. Furthermore the private lenders that make money by giving access to these loans have every reason to mislead and misconstrue the nature of their financial 'products'. 1st generation students and immigrants are the hardest hit by this system, because they are the least equipped to navigate the paperwork and financial footguns offered by the federal government for worthless degrees[3].\n\nIf you doubt the fundamental folly of our penny pinching just look at the American K-12 education system. Sure it's not perfect, but it's far from the worst and American students aren't being bankrupted by it[4]. Only the far right and libertarians are clamoring to deconstruct our public schools[5]. The college funding system we had before the student loan bonanza was perfectly sensible. We gave public universities generous amounts of money in exchange for keeping tuition low, and made the costs that remained functionally free for students with merit through grants. This allowed college to be optional while still being cheap, and provided a quality education to the students that needed one[6]. As it stands now the average IQ of college graduates has declined to the point where it is now the population average. It is necessarily the case that if intelligence is distributed on a bell curve and everyone goes to college then the experience has to be cheapened to what the average person can handle. American higher education is no longer a costly signal of erudition, and why? So we could eke out another underwater basket weaver for $300,000? We are now at the point where we are *forgiving* the extremely expensive college loans our government paid for so that our young people reaching middle age can move on with their lives[7]. These forgiveness programs are not coming with any major reform, so here's a simple proposal: Make public university free for those with merit and ban the de-facto occupational licensing represented by every Dick, Tom, and Harry demanding a 4 year degree on their job listings. The secretarial work you used to be able to get a job doing out of high school did not suddenly skyrocket in complexity over the past few decades.", "corrections":["This version starts by acknowledging that the college and university system has taken a lot of criticism recently for both imposing heavy costs on students and perceived political favoritism.", "This version acknowledges the complexity of the university system, that it is not just a public utility but a mixture of public and private organizations.", "Instead of ignoring that the government already has an alternative policy to making college free: offering loans, this analogical translation directly criticizes the current policy so it can present free college as an alternative.", "The argument borrows the energy and momentum of existing criticism so that it can meet opposition where they are and propose a different course of action.", "This argument is frank and does not overly-idealize the public education system, which has also received recent criticism and accusations of political favoritism.", "By pointing out that the reader might have disparate opinions about the K-12 system vs. college the author begins to induce cognitive dissonance, and therefore the necessary warrant for considering their alternative belief to resolve the tension.", "The author gives specific details about how the system could be different, and helps legitimize these by pointing out they are how the system in fact used to work.", "By directly connecting the provision of student loans with the decline of American university education the author taps into the rage that many on the American right feel about how we're failing to hold colleges accountable for dismal outcomes."]}
