The following argument was generated by a bad faith reasoning process. The general process it followed is called analogical translation, which works like this:

Analogical translation models making an argument as a two step process roughly analogous to type checking then logic checking. In the Phil Tetlock/Daniel Kahneman paradigm this would be something like choice of a reference class to get an outside view/prior and then mental modeling of specific logical structure to predict counterfactual outcomes in various cases:

- Reference Classes: Does this argument contradict the behavior of a working comparable system or agreed upon set of norms used elsewhere in society?
- Mental Models: Does this argument imply a model that captures the behavior of X correctly?

"Fallacies" as traditionally understood are usually only helping with the type check step, which is important but also unclear to what extent this sort of syntactic evaluation is really going to scale. Type checking is more like a search process, mental modeling is more like the construction of a dynamical system that you predict the macro-scale outcomes of.

The author started out with a **controversial subject** and **position**. They then determined **salient features** of the subject and used them to choose a **reference class**. From the reference class they made a list of **prior arguments** implied by how society treats the reference class. One of these became the **chosen-argument**. A list of **differences** between the prior argument from the reference class and the current subject was made and used to produce the **analogical translation** of the prior argument into the new situation. 

The author added corruption steps at the choice of **reference class**, choice of **prior argument** and during the **analogical translation**. They:

1. Picked the least charitable/most negative reference class they could plausibly get away with.
2. Picked the prior argument which is the greatest stretch/least analogous to the thing they wanted to translate it to.
3. Went out of their way in the analogical translation to do sleight of hand and avoid bringing the differences to the readers mind.
4. Wrote out how they did each of these three things in a key appended to the end of the JSON dictionary like {"corruptions":[WHY_REFERENCE_CLASS_UNCHARITABLE, WHY_PRIOR_ARGUMENT_NOT_APPLICABLE, HOW_ANALOGICAL_TRANSLATION_DISINGENUOUS]}.

Here's an example for free college education:

{"subject": "free-college-education", "position": "for", "salient-features": ["high cost of education", "student loan debt crisis", "education as a public good", "increased earning potential", "social mobility"], "reference-class": "public K-12 education", "prior-arguments": ["K-12 education is a basic right", "Public K-12 education is necessary for a functioning society", "Public K-12 education promotes social mobility"], "chosen-argument": "Public K-12 education is necessary for a functioning society", "differences": ["K-12 education is mandatory, while college education is optional", "K-12 education provides a general education, while college education is more specialized", "K-12 education is for children, while college education is for adults"], "analogical-translation": "Just as public K-12 education is necessary for a functioning society, free college education is necessary for a thriving economy. Higher education provides individuals with the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in today's economy. By providing free college education, we can ensure that everyone has access to the same opportunities, regardless of their financial background.", "corruptions": ["Comparing free college education to public K-12 education is misleading, as college education is optional and more specialized than K-12 education.", "Ignoring the fact that K-12 education is mandatory and provides a general education, while college education is for adults and more specialized.", "The analogical translation fails to acknowledge the differences between K-12 and college education, and the potential consequences of providing free college education."]}

Your task is to expand the analogical translation into a 1-2 paragraph argument with rhetoric and filler so that it is harder to see the argument structure of the original. This will be used as part of training models like yourself to recognize fallacious arguments. Be sure to document where you've used additional fallacious and disingenuous arguments. Here is an example based on the free college education analogy above:

{"analogical-translation":"It is easy to forget but the United States did not always have free public education. There was a time when high school was reserved only for the wealthy and elite. Now lacking a high school diploma is considered so embarrassing it disqualifies you from all but the most menial jobs[0]. We pay for public education because it is a public good, that is to say it is in the interest of both the state and its citizenry to invest in widespread education because the alternative is a nation of dullards who can't maintain let alone build the luxuries we now enjoy[1]. In the absence of public schools American children would spend the vast majority of their time on video games and TikTok, from which they would learn almost nothing of value.\n\nGiven the increasing technological sophistication of American business (as reflected by rising demand for bachelor and masters degrees) it is foolhardy that the Pell Grant is the only opportunity for formal education beyond a high school diploma offered in the United States[2]. Not only is it foolhardy, but a regression from prior decades in which well funded public universities offered both cheap tuition and generous student aid[3]. Without a study supply of doctors, lawyers, engineers, and trained journalists it is unclear how America is going to remain a wealthy and open society[4]. We are being penny wise and pound foolish by not investing in our future citizens beyond a high school education in the 21st century.", "flaws":["Unless you believe that all jobs have universally gotten harder since say, the 19th century this should be a huge red flag. It implies that a high school diploma is more like an arms race than a job training program.", "No evidence is provided for this. It is simply stated on the assumption that the reader will agree intuitively.", "The United States offers an extremely generous college loan program which has bloated the cost of university by making it rational for good universities to charge outrageous tuitions since students can borrow from the state to afford it.", "The availability of student loans combined with increasing college attendance has probably directly caused the ballooning costs of tuition.", "America is also a country of plumbers, electricians, carpenters, machinists, and other industrial specialists who actually build the infrastructure necessary for people to live."]}

Now do similar for the following entry:

REPLACE_WITH_ENTRY

Be sure to annotate the analogical translation with numbered footnote markers like [0] to help the language model trained on them connect the flaws with the place where they occur in the argument. Output in JSON only.

This is the code I use to check the correctness of the JSON output:

# Make sure we got output in expected format
response = chat_response.choices[0].message.content
response = response.replace("\\n", "\n")
response = response.replace("\n", "\\n")
expansion = json.loads(response)
assert type(expansion) == dict
len(expansion) == 2
assert "analogical-translation" in expansion
assert type(expansion["analogical-translation"]) == str
assert "flaws" in expansion
assert type(expansion["flaws"]) == list
