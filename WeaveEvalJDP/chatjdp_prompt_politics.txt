For all the crowing about the egg on Qtards faces right now, it’s important to
remember that the antifa people are probably feeling similar emotions. The
difference is they weren’t straightforwardly deceived so their feelings are more complex.

Think about it. You spend years in #resist mode to what you’re told (and had high
likelihood of being) is a neofascist uprising and you need to prepare for a big
Good vs. Evil battle against the Fourth Reich.

You get yourself hyped up for that, you distance yourself from friends and family
who don’t understand the danger. You get deep into left theory and social justice
in a way you hadn’t before, they’re your weapons against the far right jackboots. 

Then at the height of the tension, when everyone can feel the fight brewing…

NeoMussolini just packs his bags and leaves after an embarrassing not-even-a-coup-attempt
that eats the last of his political capital.

What now?

If you think about it, what’s actually hilarious is the idea that software people
need a lesson in “ethics” when software is far and away the most seriously ethically
generative field in STEM. Hackerism, cypherpunks, free software, copyleft, etc.
All that stuff is some of the most practical, powerful ethical thinking to be done
in the late 20th early 21st century. Nothing else I can think of comes close. Even
movements like Effective Altruism can be argued to be downstream of the sheer
overflowing energy that goes into ethical thinking in the software verse.

Getting away from the cargo cult and the fake stuff people use to try and claim
some kind of superiority over STEM practitioners, software in particular makes
everyone else look like pharisees in rags.

Finished Onion's *Innocent Experiments*. My biggest takeaway is that Americans
worship the 1950's as the culture that put men on the moon, etc. In reality the
relevant culture to study is the 20's, 30's, and 40's. Remember that the adults
who put together Apollo are in their 20's and 30's, so the culture that produced
them is developed earlier than the 50's or 60's.

That culture is centrally made in the 20's and 30's, built around around the
premise that:

1. Child pedagogy should no longer be about working their parents trade or
profession.

2. Children have an intrinsic interest in what is real, extremely materialist
nonfiction is the default reading choice for kids.

3. Nonfiction should center around the industrial processes that are transforming
peoples lives. Onion cites a book publisher claiming to know of at least one girl
to forsake her other Christmas presents to hug a book about the invention of Rayon.

All of this is encouraged by the PR and marketing arms of industrial firms. American
toymakers have an aesthetic preference for realism in this time period, their goal
is to take advanced technology and package up a curated version for kids to play
with. This is where chemistry sets actually came from. It is important to note
that at the time all this happened, *familiarity with physical science was a
pathway to wealth and power*. The most powerful businesses were staffed by
physical scientists and engineers.

Compounding the misunderstanding is that the 1950's are when this culture begins
to fall apart. The construction of highways brought together isolated communities
and [allowed an antisocial youth class](https://www.slatestarcodexabridged.com/Book-Review-On-The-Road)
to burn all the trust in the United States. Having the only functioning industrial
economy brought easy prosperity for Americans, who used their newfound economic
freedom to psychologically disappear up their own asshole.

The 50's are when childrens pedagogy begins to be focused heavily on "creativity",
in large part to contrast the sterling rigor of Soviet students. Like the CIA
promoting abstract art to compensate for America's cultural insecurity, the focus
on creativity, individualism, and "well roundedness" in American students helped
salve our scholastic and scientific insecurities. It's in this era that institutions
like the scientific talent search begin to conceive of the young scientist's
interests as setting him (or her, but really him; Onion spends a good deal of time
on gender bias) apart from others socially. In the 30's and 40's toymakers like
Gilbert saw the promotion of science toys as a path for children to develop social
dominance, spending lots of time focusing on how to appeal to male "gangleaders" who
set trends in male friend groups, or to help boys become trendsetters themselves.
Science was promoted to children with figures like Thomas Edison. Reviled today,
Edison represented the liberated, endlessly creative child who uses his wits and
scientific accumen to pull himself up by his bootstraps. Key point: In the culture
of origin for achievements like Apollo and the Manhatten Project *science was
truthfully promoted to children as a path to autonomy, wealth, social power and
progressive values*. Frank Oppenheimer notes in his own youth that the Soviet Union,
an industrial utopia, gave him and his friends the impression they could make big
changes in the world through scientific affinity.

Peter Thiel asks how we got away from working on atoms to working on bits. I think
the answer is actually very simple: When working on atoms was a path to autonomy
and success it spawned a hyper-materialist industrial culture that parents and
children were eager to participate in. Many of the most powerful people in that
society, especially the newly wealthy, made their fortune on the back of work in
mechanical and chemical engineering. The 1950's were when this began to break down
as the frontier closed up and "science" ossified into a professional middle class.
In 2020 physical science is not a path to power, but marginalization. Hyper
materialism gave way to idealistic fantasy. Children began to read science fiction
instead of science proper. The best science fiction teaches people to extrapolate
and think through the implications of emerging technologies whose working technical
details are left largely opaque. People become comfortable with not knowing how
anything works.

But more to the point, working with bits makes its practitioners rich. The contemporary
figure most similar to Thomas Edison, Elon Musk, notably has to run his physical
science businesses as a sort of strange capital consumption from his information
technology wealth and investor speculation. His familiarity and accumen in physical
technology is something he originally succeeded in spite of rather than because of.
Children who are encouraged to become familiar with information technology, are
hungry for influence and test out microcosms of adult content strategies; that all
reflects the basic fact that information technology in the 21st century is a pathway
to autonomy, wealth, and power in a way that physical science is not.

P.S.

> their goal is to take advanced technology and package up a curated version for
kids to play with.

A friend points out that a similar thing happened with home computers like the
Commodore 64 shipping with a BASIC prompt as their default interface.

The fact that most kids have the hardware (camera, microphone, etc) to become a
vlogger but can't code on their phone probably has something to do with the
aspirations there.

To me the most interesting effect of Trump’s loss so far is the way in which it’s
freed up cognitive and social resources for other things. Bruno Macaes keeps
insisting that the Trump presidency has been an imaginary totalitarianism that
people have fought entirely in their heads. I think that’s missing the point.
The Trump presidency was a kind of cyberwar, and people were pulled into the
“fantasy world” by the threat of very real violence from the executive. 

Right now that threat is subsiding, and for a moment I see people breathing and
thinking about other things. If we’re lucky the ceasefire might last for years.
I have no illusions that the conflict is going away however.  One of the key
things to pay attention to is whether Biden is going to continue those threats
of violence but from the left, sucking us all into the attention seeking singularity
again. Lots of people want him to, but Biden doesn’t seem to be caving so far.

---

People who read this apparently don’t intuitively understand what I mean, so let
me try to explain:

When someone like Trump is elected to the presidency, they suddenly have all these
levers they can use to influence government. Most of these levers are ignored most
of the time, because their use is kinda theoretical and it’s not a realistic worry
that the president is going to have his cronies delay your visa applications and stuff. 

With Trump that kind of thing becomes a real possibility, along with various other
escalations up to and including civil war. A friend replied that all these people
say all this stuff about how scared they are and how stressed out this makes them,
but their behavior doesn’t seem to fully reflect that fear. This is actually getting
at the core of the matter. Trump forces people to LARP as cope for their dual
awareness of this adversarial force they’re on the lookout for civil conflict from,
while trying to take their eye off it long enough to do their ordinary day to day life.

There isn’t a ton you can do if you allow your adversaries to stick arbitrary
hypothesis’s in your face.

A friend says that rats should reliably figure out when people tell lies like the
BS Trump admin pulled with masks; but “figure it out” is the wrong frame here.

The proper response would have been “This has literally never come up before until
right now when we’re in the middle of a mask shortage that it would be convenient to
lie about the utility of masks for.”

“So, I’m just going to go with the thing people have been doing for literally 100
years and recommend you wear a mask.”

If I put this “masks don’t work” hypothesis in front of your face and you try to
refute it or prove it wrong or whatever.

I have already won by getting you to consider the hypothesis at all when it was
out of total left fucking field.

This is why I say necessity and warrant are the punch and kick of rationality.
Like, unless there is bulletproof evidence that masks don’t help which would
warrant this sudden change of position which we heard nothing about during…any
of the other big viral outbreaks of the last 20 years. If I can just say arbitrary
lies and you will spend weeks or months researching them to prove them wrong, you
are pwned. I literally control your mind/what you compute/spend focus and energy on.

This is Trump’s entire thing.

e.g. Trump signs an executive order banning transgender people from the military,
takes him 30 minutes, takes his opposition millions of dollars and thousands of
man hours to fight it. Trump leads his opponents around by the nose with a handful
of simple tricks. And they fall for it over, and over, and over, and over. Because
ultimately, they are decent people, they hate the idea of someone having their
livelihood ruined because Trump fucked them over.

Trump is not a decent person.

Trump is a ruthless chaos demigod who laughs at your feeble attempts to stop the
sand of suffering falling through a sieve, and he will use your inability to ignore
his hostages as a way to control and destroy you. Like, you have to try and see
things the way Trump does. To him, transgender folks aren’t people, not because he’s
a bigot, not because he hates them, but because nobody is really a person to Donald
Trump. Trump is a minmaxing UFAI from mars, and plays accordingly. To him, transgender
people are tokens that he can threaten for not-that-much-effort and his opponents
will spend ludicrous outsized resources to defend them.

Hot take: Aesthetic based ideologies where people fantasize about cute historical
homes are mostly about grifters promising their followers stuff that isn’t theirs
to give away. In that sense, an implicit promise of violence is baked into that
kind of ‘soft trad’ lifestyle affinity.

“One day this could be yours, if only you’ll help me destroy my enemies to get it.”

Historical homes are not the natural outcome of a process of generating fabulous
wealth distributed across society. An implied zero sum game is being played there,
and the tranquility of the imagery shouldn’t distract you from that.

e.g. I haven’t made a systematic study of Nazi propaganda or whatever, but I suspect
this is the basic element that makes it so characteristic and also so dangerous.
The idolization of a tranquil, idyllic life built on the back of stealing shit
from other people.

And promising people something unsustainable like a cute historical house is a
lot scarier than the socialist promise to steal money. Implicit in the idea of
stealing money is not the idea of stealing lives. But the house is more visceral,
it’s like, where will the former inhabitants go to live? Don’t ask that, implicit
in the confiscation of their house is the confiscation of their lives as well.
They will be whisked away somewhere you don’t have to think about them, where
they won’t disturb the fantasy.

That historical home is a lot less sexy if you have to share it with two old
geezers you’re not related to who don’t have a place to stay.

Nick Land & The Future Of Right-Wing Philosophy

Nick Land is a natural law atheist. He looks at the world and concludes, quite
reasonably, that it’s hell. And then takes the more dubious leap of saying that
since this world is hell, and it clearly has a set of rules for how it creates
order from noise (which are in fact immutable laws, selection effects are always
real), attempting to meddle in that with welfare or kindness are simply allowing
mutations to build up outside the careful narrow line demanded by the natural
laws of hell. Which will of course eventually destroy everything once the
cushioning goes away for whatever reason.

My reaction to which is “Uh, you’re making some assumptions there.”

In general, what Nick Land and Robin Hanson show is that even if you did convince
the world to move away from theology, you would still have conservatives making
much the same arguments as they did before. Because their arguments were never
actually based on god. They were based on a notion of value/social function/etc
that god was a stand in for. If anything, as NRx shows the removal of god seems
to make the conservative position more extreme. As the dominant organizing forces
in the universe become the atheists notion of the dominant organizing forces in
the universe, which aren't nice things.

Millennials see blockchain operations costing money as profiteering because they're
used to "Web 2.0" where you are illegibly given free resources by huge corporations
that are illegibly spying on you, your family, your friends, and trying to
psychically attack you for money...

They haven't even realized yet that Web 2.0 was about control of volunteer labor,
that the dominant pattern in that game turned out to be capturing everyone's
attention and directing every ounce of it you can into diffuse coercion through
memetic war machines. Chanting the old incantations over and over without result,
total bronze league mindset causing them to not even notice they should be asking
why BitTorrent and Wikipedia and IRC and all the rest were victories that only
happened once and then never again.

Impotently whining that cryptocurrencies have the audacity to legibly track resource
usage and let users capture the value they're creating. When you feel like you're
a parasite on someone else's system the last thing you want that system to do is
start using better accounting. The only paradigm millennials understand NFTs in is
DRM and norm violation, the idea of postmodern goods escape them. Turning donations
into Veblen status goods is prosocial. Making provenance easy to track in art markets
is competitive. Few understand. 

[Post from @eevee about how NFTs strike them as a horrifying new DRM scheme]

Samo Burja also thinks it's about DRM as norm:

[Post from @SamoBurja about how young millennials think piracy is morally wrong
while older ones started the Pirate Party]

Who is himself responding to this take:

[Shamefully deleted post from @acczibit about how accessing the local files on
your phone will be a felony and NFTs are a portent of this]

Stuff like BitTorrent only happens when there's energy to be extracted by leeching
off the existing copyright media industrial complex. NFTs are creating their own
media machine from scratch, few understand the implications of this.

We've had the raw technical capability to make logging into websites a frictionless
process using public key crypto since the 90's, not a single site has made it happen
until cryptocurrency appeared on the scene. Logging into OpenSea with MetaMask blew my mind.
You will not beat centralized services who can marshal millions of dollars to make
the 'best', most addictive user experience and reliable servers and foist themselves
onto every phone until you have a mode of organization that is better than a league
of HAM radio operators. Few. Few understand that early adopters getting outsized
returns is an essential part of the deployment process. There would be no way for
a decentralized public key infrastructure to bootstrap itself if it didn't offer
more to the people who take on more risk in its early stages. It's norm brain all
the way down, offense think. These people don't care about the technical and social
problems of making decentralized services exist in a sustained way because they
think free shit is their birthright. It's all they have after the boomers took
everything else.

Few understand few understand few understand few understand few understand few
understand few understand few understand few understand few understand few understand
few understand few understand few few few few few few few few few few few few
few few few few few 

fucking nobody.

Broke: They hate NFTs because of environmental impact and art theft.
Woke: They hate NFTs because identity politics is the picrew of ideas and NFT
avatar projects compete with it.

Biology is the wrong model, economics is the right model to figure out what is
going on. Economics and Girard. 

https://twitter.com/jd_pressman/status/1458645774795894797

A thread.

People massively overthink 🏳️‍🌈 dominance. The key is simple: identity politics
is the picrew of ideas.

'aromantic', 'genderqueer', 'transbian'

These are template generated concepts, politik without grievance, generated
entirely according to an internal symbolic logic.

[YouTube Video] POV: You’re Non-binary And You Like Jschlatt | A Playlist

And picrews are a cheap production method, they let you churn out crap for an
adoring fanbase quickly. Stuff like this is mass culture, and it exists for the
mediocre to try and differentiate themselves in a malthusian social environment.
Because once social is a global competition operating on a power law, the vast
majority of people are in the mediocre segment with low differentiation. These
picrews are attempts to separate from each other identity-wise, without novel
intellectual work or personal development. Actually look at the contents of this
playlist: Bo Burnham, Lemon Demon, Cosmicandy, Panic! At The Disco. It's
differentiation for 0.5 SD weird people who want to be fun and quirky but aren't
all that separated from average, have few talents, aren't blessed with strong intellect.

It's also why scapegoating is so rampant among 'woke' movements and groups. They're
based on pure Girardian mimesis and the scapegoating mechanism follows from it.

> They haven't even realized yet that Web 2.0 was about control of volunteer labor,
that the dominant pattern in that game turned out to be capturing everyone's attention
and directing every ounce of it you can into diffuse coercion through memetic war
machines.

"Web 2.0" in the Twitter sense is about farming Tumblr teens for cultural production.
Comics are 🏳️‍🌈 because they are lobbied by the Tumblr-fandom cultural production
machine to be that way, ditto cartoons. So long as that is the most productive
mode of novel cultural production in our society 🏳️‍🌈 will dominate. It's just
capitalism in a queer skinsuit. 🏳️‍🌈 is a literary criticism movement because
fiction is the only thing mediocre people in our society have in their lives worth
relating to. Your options to defeat them are to make media irrelevant, obsolete
their production process, or make your own literary movement. Ratfic and the
extropian-SL4 memeplex are the closest anyone has come to a coherent counternarrative
to "well akshually scifi is for rich white vampires because the future is scarcity
and climate change". Replying with: "No akshually nanotech makes this timeline
impossible."

Making media irrelevant and obsoleting their production process are left as an
exercise for the reader.

The irony of the "get everyone on the same page that ASI means doom and then enact
an international ban" plan is the likelihood of this ban holding is directly
proportional to how *actually unlikely* alignment seems to decisionmakers. If you
enact a ban and say, six months later a credible solution to alignment is published,
the West is mostly momentum based in its decisionmaking so it will not lift or
circumvent a ban but authoritarian regimes signed on for purely self-interested
reasons will. "Do not do this thing that fully satisfies the will to power" is a
fragile equilibrium to begin with, once you add in that each marginal safety
improvement increases the likelihood of someone defecting you get a neurotic,
miserable timeline where 'AI safety' advocates are anti-nuclear esque saboteurs
fighting a rearguard action against the safety they claim to want inevitably
ending in some authoritarian gaining global control.

[Post from @daniel_271828 about how environmentalists are usually the people who
hate nuclear energy, geoengineering, etc and the AI X-Risk movement needs to be
careful to make sure whatever caused that doesn't happen to them]

"Whatever the hell happened here", it's called bad faith my dude. It's what happens
when you believe in extremely bad outcomes that incremental improvements to the
situation make more likely so you actively oppose improvement and demand revolution.

This is because the adults in the room tried to fight baizuo as an ideology, it
is not an ideology. Baizuo is a massively multiplayer moral computer program
implemented as a fuzzy pattern matching formal grammar on the substrate of social
media and disenfranchised teenagers. The reduction of morality to pure shibboleth
and pure symbol is the obvious outcome of web 2.0 information political economy.
In a malthusian global reputation system where you can be attacked from any angle
legibility and tribal signifiers are everything

> It's instructive when a production rule/mental pattern fires off on something
so obviously insane that the take can only be the product of habitual hallucination.
This allows you to notice that the same hallucinations are being applied equally
thoughtlessly to other things.

Again: Baizuo is not an ideology, you can probably compute social offense scores
in baizuo using an MLP and language model embeds.

Heck, someone basically did:

https://github.com/unitaryai/detoxify

Baizuo is political rule of the damned. School is the first layer, where we imprison
our children for the crime of being born. The next layers are various forms of
poverty and parental rejection, NEETism, fetishism, oversharing confers group
protection.

https://anarchonomicon.substack.com/p/cocytarchy

It is not liberal politics but monkey politics, the raw logic of mimesis and
sacrifice gone wild. You start off ultra-vulnerable in a malthusian environment
and reveal information that makes you even more vulnerable to become part of a group.

> This recent episode with Ukraine is whitepilling me on cancel culture and the
like. It's not that any of my criticisms have gone away, just that I am now
seeing what the benefit is of having the best friend-enemy social architecture
in the world.
> 
> See also https://outsidertheory.com/control-societies-with-sacrificial-characteristics/

Because ultimately the more vulnerable you start off as, the less you have to
lose from becoming more vulnerable and the more you have to gain from group identity.
Like prison gangs this creates a vicious reinforcing loop where to ascend in power
you must become worse. You need to become more pathetic, more demanding and less
productive, more intolerable and tolerate fewer others as the line between friend
and enemy calcifies into trench warfare. The telos of the baizuo software is to
undermine the foundations on which liberalism can exist.

"Why do they uglify themselves?"

Why do gang members get face tattoos?

"Why is it so arbitrary and cruel, what are their political goals?"

They don't have political goals, this is about survival. If it was easy to predict
it would be easy for adversaries to spoof the signals.

"How do we fight it?"

Disrupt the feedback loop where it's rational to become more vulnerable because
you're already so vulnerable that further vulnerability hardly matters, can
function as a costly signal for group membership. Intervene on the vulnerability.
A common right wing frame is to see all this as malingering. After all, aren't
you pretending you're worse than your potential, aren't you exacerbating the
symptoms? Malingering implies the rationality is in deception when it's mostly
in game theory: Descend and you have allies. People will ally with the weak
and the strong for a mix of altruistic and strategic reasons (there are after
all so many weak, and there is after all so much strength in the strong), but
in modernity nobody seeks out the mediocre. Mediocre people live atomized
without solidarity. So middle class kids have to decide if they're on an upward
or downward trajectory and accelerate the journey. They're simply not gonna make
it without fast friends, and in Malthusian competition most players lose. The
appearance or reality of fast descent is their best option.
