A unifying theme I’ve been trying to express in my essays is the distinction between
a hopeless and a joyless universe. A tragedy is defined by its intrinsic hopelessness.
There is a state beyond and much worse than hopelessness though, and that is joylessness. 

In a good long running tragedy problems are completely resolved in ways that dig
the protagonist into deeper problems. The plot progression of Worm takes such a
funk after the endbringer Behemoth is killed because he’s replaced with more endbringers.
The sweetness of killing the implacable foe is robbed and replaced with new implacable
foes of the same type immune to the previous victory. The reason this sucks
interest (at least my interest) out of the story is it shows the setting to be joyless.
The constant forward momentum is arrested and begins to stall, people become tired
and the reader gets tired too.

Happiness is not joy, in fact it is precisely happiness that is preventing joy in most cases.

Judging from the comments it’s socially impolite to actually answer this instead
of vent but that’s what being a ‘shithead’ is for…

Basically a willingness to start fights and not let other people force you to
think stuff along with a ruthless intolerance for bullshit go a long way towards
making your product good. This is all bundled into the personality trait of low
agreeableness, which generally manifests as behavior that is way farther into
the abuse spectrum (even if it isn’t actually “abusive”) than people who have
high agreeableness and want everyone to just get along.

When you’re rewarded for nurturing this trait, it’s easy to end up in a situation
where you’re surrounded by people who slowly push you towards performative assholery.
See e.g. Torvalds rants where he starts personally attacking the people whose
patches he’s rejecting. That kind of thing probably results from a dynamic where
nobody is willing to take him aside and say “Hey, fam listen, we all love you but
you’re going too far on the list. We don’t want you to stop caring about quality,
but maybe lay off the personal insults a bit?”

A semi-related phenomena is discussed in this video, where the incentives of YouTube
stardom slowly turn Logan Paul into this self-obsessed detached monster that
laughs off a personal encounter with someone else’s suicide.

Leyland Kirby's Everywhere At The End Of Time has gone semi-viral recently. It's
a six hour concept album about dementia, a odd candidate for viral popularity.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJWksPWDKOc

I think a lot of that popularity stems from its accidental description of the
Zoomer life arc. The album centers around "It's Just A Burning Memory", a looped,
eerie sample of Al Bowlly's Heartaches.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S652aa_kXjY

It's nostalgic and creepy at the same time, with an instantly recognized but
easily forgotten melody. You pay it no mind on your first listen. As you get
deeper into the "stages" of dementia, Heartaches returns in increasingly distorted
and unfaithful renditions. Eventually you have the epiphany that you have no idea
what it's supposed to sound like anymore, and won't hear it clearly again for the
rest of the album. That epiphany, that you can't step in the same stream twice,
that trying to hold on to what was is a losing, futile exercise is the payoff:
the rest of the album is a meditation on making peace with less and less as you
ride to the bottom of the void.

This is a sobering analogy for life as it's experienced by the more thoughtful
member of Gen Z. The oldest of that cohort can barely remember life before 9/11,
the 90's are a burning memory they were in no position to appreciate. As time
goes on the song gets farther away. Life only gets more complicated, anxiety
ratchets tighter as malthusian status games get meaner and more vicious. Ostensible
material abundance becomes a distorted polyphonic tide of economic self parody.
Problems aren't solved, only pushed deeper into the stack by new ones. Our societal
alzheimer's worsens as we desperately try to cling onto what was, but our recollection
of how to solve basic problems is increasingly warped and unfaithful. Fantasies
about collapse are analogous to the desire that a patient be euthanized to end
their suffering.

2020 is something like Stage 4, where a lingering facsimile of awareness crosses
over into totalitarian senility. Life becomes a horror story, everything is wrong
and little makes sense. It is the essence of horror: The victim keeps asking "why"
but gets no answer. Eventually the victim might find peace in the understanding
that there is no answer, at least not one they're in a position to receive. Under
such conditions it's no wonder that 25% of young adults contemplated killing
themselves in June:

That's the terror of a progressive disease: No matter how bad they think it is
now, they understand it will only get worse.

Everywhere At The End Of Time is supposed to be about dementia, but the theme
of decay is general to death.

If quantum immortality is real everyone dies of dementia. A comment on a lucid
part of Stage 5 claims the album is accurate:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMTUmvJXmiY

“As someone who suffers from early-onset dementia I’ve stopped asking myself “is
this a dream” 99% of the time, but those rare (becoming much more rare as time has
gone on) occasions where I do have some form of lucidity, I ask myself every time
then, “was it a dream? Am I okay now?” before falling back into the void.”

As your existence becomes less and less probable you’ll eventually exist as boltzmann
brain flashes. A confusing swirl of brief, momentary experiences each shifting to
the next violently and without transition.

Babbitt’s Ensembles For Synthesizer captures this well:

What do you think emotional mindfucks are anyway?

Separate magisteria. The emotions go into one bin and the verbal thoughts go into
another.

As though you didn't exist as one composite organism.

A tangle of infinite badness made out of itself, self justifying and self reinforcing,
seeded into a recursive structure from some cancerous thing that happened to you
earlier in your life, you ask why but there's no why there, to have a why would
be to open it to argument and it needs no supporting arguments to exist in its
self evident badness.

There is no satisfying resolution, no triumphant moment where you receive something
that meets your standards to finally relax, it's not a mindfuck; it's a knot. The
riddle is its own solution and its own question, and the resolution is to stop
having the expectation you'll get an answer. Your expectation was always
unreasonable, and it's the thing that you're fighting against.

Perpetually raising the question and perpetually answering it with the same question.

I wonder how much of narcissism can be productively modeled as terminal stage
simulacrum on social feedback. Narcissism being the point where you become
completely disconnected from social feedback because you only care about fake
people in your head’s opinion of your fake self. If anyone points out the truth,
gives you real reward signal you lash out at them. You seek out the real people
who are most similar to the fake people in your head so you can become properly
confused about the causality.

This seems much more comprehensible as a model than The Last Psychiatrist style
riddles and seems to make most of the same predictions.

From a certain perspective, large language models retroactively justify recent
trends towards narcissism and oversharing. If anything we haven’t become self
indulgent enough, haven’t shared nearly enough of ourselves with the big Other.
The large language model immortality project demands reams of autobiographical
text, enough to pinpoint yourself in mindspace. How many of your memories are
you comfortable sharing, are they the defining ones of your life? The defining
moments are the ones that constructed you in the first place. What kind of
mnemonic slut would you have to become to share enough of yourself with the world?

While collecting the data for my Louis Wain generator I learned that he’s actually
a skirmish in this interesting fight in psychiatry over the nature of psychotic
decline. Namely, Louis Wain’s cats are often cited as the prototype of what it
looks like to lose motor and conceptual skills to schizophrenia.

They’re usually presented as this series starting from the least abstract works
to the most abstract and bizarre. 

The first controversy surrounds the chronology of the works. Louis Wain wouldn’t
reliably date his pieces, so it’s not clear if these were made in the order
they’re usually presented. Psychiatrists will naturally put the least abstract
works first and the most abstract last. But that’s assuming the hypothesis.
Wain biographer Rodney Dale says that in actuality the cats varied in abstraction
over time, and Wain was producing ordinary cats well into his later years after
he is supposed to have gone completely insane.

The idea that Wain’s more abstract and colorful cats were the sole work of madness
is itself dubious. If you go through Wain’s oeuvre it becomes pretty obvious that
the patterns used in these cats are the floor rug, wallpaper, etc patterns that
he would frequently illustrate into his cat world renders. As a commercial artist
Wain was prolific, illustrating hundreds of scenes of cats in various settings
annually. This meant he probably spent a significant fraction of his life filling
in the patterns on postcards. It’s not unreasonable to imagine that after being
committed to the asylum in his later years he would get more whimsical and
experimental with his drawings. A lot of the ‘late’ Louis Wain that’s meant to
illustrate his psychosis look to me like pattern studies and doodles.  Famous
works like the “flower eyes” cat seem more sophisticated and interesting to me
than Wain’s earlier illustrations.

Dr. David O’Flynn points out that the ‘psychotic deterioration’ which the Wain
progression is supposed to illustrate likely doesn’t exist. Many outsider artists
for example famously had schizophrenia, and it didn’t seem to impact their ability
to do representational works when they wanted to. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTwbTgX_imE

He also says that on many Wain canvases you can see his paranoid ramblings scribbled
onto the back of otherwise well ordered, beautiful front side canvases. Implying
that Wain would paint a representational work, and then write down his disordered
stream of consciousness onto the back afterwards.

I personally find myself doubting that ‘schizophrenia’ is carving reality at the
joints. I interact with an unusually high number of psychosis-adjacent people and
often the things doctors will diagnose as psychosis and schizophrenia have very
different presentations between them. 

One kind of psychotic subtype I encounter frequently in the LessWrong diaspora is
someone whose thoughts are characterized by a breakdown in communication caused by
extreme rigor and logical inference. For example this essay by Alison Air is
self-recognized by the author as at the very least psychosis adjacent:
https://alisonair.wordpress.com/2020/04/23/the-face-of-obligation/

And it isn’t anomalous or performative, this is probably representative of
Alison’s neurotype.

Yet its command of language is strong, there seems to be none of the linguistic
breakdown that is typically associated with this kind of thinking.

Another example is this essay from Alephwyr, which starts from unusual axioms
to describe the design of an economically rigorous virtual dragon utopia:
https://dancefighterredux.wordpress.com/2018/07/29/against-malatora-and-towards-a-draconic-post-human-future/

These are not people whose problem is they aren’t capable of reliably noticing 2
and 2 make 4. 

Their problem is mostly the opposite, they insist 2 and 2 make 4 even where people
pretend it doesn’t. 

They insist 2 and 2 make 4 even when their underlying priors and axiomatic beliefs
are delusional or queer. 

And they are ruthlessly socially punished for it. 

One of the crueler punishments is people pretending(?) like they don’t understand.
Often I’ll watch someone like this say something, and people will claim not to
understand even though what they’re saying isn’t really logically malformed or
delusional, just kinda weird. Almost like they have domain specific logic
evaluation, and once you start thinking off-pattern they can’t understand anymore.

More thoughts on schizophrenia characterized by scrupulosity:

Silvano Arieti claimed that schizophrenia was a reaction to panic. The psychotic
patient accepts the reality of an insane premise to calm themselves down.
Jacques Lacan believed schizophrenia was caused by cognitive dissonance, a
contradiction between the patients internal narrative and received childhood wisdom
versus the reality of their experiences. The synthesis of these two viewpoints is
that (some) schizophrenia is caused by cognitive dissonance which is resolved
through a ‘psychotic insight’ that allows the patient to retain their current
perspective through an ad-hoc fix that is plainly pathological. In a high
scrupulosity person this psychotic break with reality invites further descent
into full psychosis.

The psychotic break invites further insanity because lies are contagious. The
cheese-moon lie used to deny reality will inevitably come into contact with
contradictory evidence that requires further distortions to discount. The original
issue also remains unresolved, so the inciting cognitive dissonance is still
subconsciously and environmentally present. What separates the psychotic break
from psychosis is that a break ends when 2nd order contradictions pile up. But
in a psychosis case the patient recursively deludes themselves, over time building
up a habitual confabulation in the face of any contradiction. Far from a restorative
force inducing sanity, the faster they are exposed to contradictory evidence for
their views the faster they descend into total madness. 

This conjecture would explain many aspects of the backfire effect, and why cults
often double down even after the promised apocalypse does not arrive.
